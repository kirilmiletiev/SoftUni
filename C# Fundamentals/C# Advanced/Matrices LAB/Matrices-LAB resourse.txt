1.Sum Matrix Elements
Write program that read a matrix from console and print:

Count of rows
Count of columns
Sum of all matrix's elements
On first line you will get matrix sizes in format [rows, columns]

Examples
Input	Output
3, 6 
7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1 
1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6 
4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0	3 
6 
76
Hints
On next [rows] lines you will get elements for each column separated with coma and whitespace
Try to use only foreach for printing
2.Maximum sum of 2x2 submatrix
Write a program that read a matrix from console. Then find biggest sum of 2x2 submatrix and print it to console.

On first line you will get matrix sizes in format rows, columns.

One next rows lines you will get elements for each column separated with coma.

Print biggest top-left square, which you find and sum of it's elements.

Examples
Input	Output
3, 6 
7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1 
1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6 
4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0	9 8 
7 9 
33
2, 4 
10, 11, 12, 13 
14, 15, 16, 17	12 13 
16 17 
58
Hints
Think about IndexOutOfRangeException()
If you find some max squares, print top-left one
3.Group Numbers
Read a set of numbers and group them by their remainder when dividing to 3 (0, 1 and 2).

One first line, you will get numbers separated with coma and whitespace.

Examples
Input	Output
1, 4, 113, 55, 3, 1, 2, 66, 557, 124, 2	3 66 
1 4 55 1 124 
113 2 557 2
1, 4, -113, 55, -3, 1, -2, 66, 557, -124, 2	-3 66 
1 4 55 1 -124 
-113 -2 557 2
Hints
Think about how to get all rows lengths
First element in each array will be easy , but what will happen with next numbers we need to add to each row. Probably you will need one more array to save next index for each row
4.Pascal Triangle
The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.

If you want more info about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle

Print each row elements separated with whitespace.

Examples
Input	Output
4	1 
1 1 
1 2 1 
1 3 3 1
13	1 
1 1 
1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
1 5 10 10 5 1 
1 6 15 20 15 6 1 
1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1 
1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 
1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1 
1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1 
1 11 55 165 330 462 462 330 165 55 11 1 
1 12 66 220 495 792 924 792 495 220 66 12 1
Hints
Input number n will be 1 <= n <= 60
Think about proper type for elements in array
Don't be scary to use more and more Arrays
